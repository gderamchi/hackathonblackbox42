---

### `/explain` - Get Detailed Explanations

Get in-depth explanations of code, issues, or concepts.

**Usage:**
```
/explain [optional question]
```

**Examples:**
```markdown
# Simple explanation
You: /explain

# Specific question
You: /explain why is this a security issue?

# Complex question
You: /explain what's the performance impact of this approach?
```

**Bot Response:**
```markdown
## 🤖 Code Explanation

This code uses string concatenation in a SQL query, which creates
a SQL injection vulnerability. Here's why:

1. **What the code does:**
   - Builds SQL query by concatenating user input
   - Executes query directly without sanitization

2. **Why it's problematic:**
   - Attackers can inject malicious SQL
   - Can lead to data theft or deletion
   - Bypasses authentication

3. **Best practices:**
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Validate and sanitize all inputs
   - Use ORM frameworks when possible

4. **Alternative approaches:**
   ```python
   # Safe approach
   cursor.execute(
       "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?",
       (user_id,)
   )
   ```

### `/suggest` - Get Alternative Implementations

See different ways to implement the same functionality.

**Usage:**
```
/suggest [optional context]
```

**Examples:**
```markdown
You: /suggest

You: /suggest more efficient approach

You: /suggest using async/await
```

**Bot Response:**
```markdown
## 🤖 Alternative Implementations

### Approach 1: Using List Comprehension
```python
result = [x * 2 for x in numbers if x > 0]
```
**Pros:** Concise, Pythonic, faster
**Cons:** Less readable for complex logic
**Use case:** Simple transformations

### Approach 2: Using filter() and map()
```python
result = list(map(lambda x: x * 2, filter(lambda x: x > 0, numbers)))
```
**Pros:** Functional style, composable
**Cons:** Less readable, multiple iterations
**Use case:** Functional programming paradigm

### Approach 3: Using Generator Expression
```python
result = (x * 2 for x in numbers if x > 0)
```
**Pros:** Memory efficient, lazy evaluation
**Cons:** Single-use iterator
**Use case:** Large datasets, streaming

---
*Want to apply one of these? Reply with `/fix` and specify which approach!*
```

---

### `/ignore` - Ignore Specific Issues

Mark an issue as intentional or false positive.

**Usage:**
```
/ignore [optional reason]
```

**Examples:**
```markdown
You: /ignore false positive

You: /ignore this is intentional for backwards compatibility

You: /ignore
```

**Bot Response:**
```markdown
## ✅ Issue Ignored

This issue has been marked as ignored.

**Reason:** false positive

The bot will not flag this issue in future reviews of this PR.

*To un-ignore, reply with `/unignore`*
```

## 💬 Natural Conversation

You don't need to use commands! Just chat naturally with the bot.

### Ways to Start a Conversation:

1. **Mention the bot:**
   ```
   @blackbox-bot can you explain this in simpler terms?
   ```

2. **Reply to bot comments:**
   ```
   Bot: 🐛 Bug detected: Potential null pointer exception
   
   You: What's the best way to fix this?
   ```

3. **Ask questions:**
   ```
   Hey bot, is there a more efficient way to do this?
   ```

4. **Request clarification:**
   ```
   I don't understand why this is a problem. Can you elaborate?
   ```

### Example Conversations:

#### Example 1: Understanding an Issue
```markdown
Bot: ⚠️ Performance Issue: Nested loops detected (O(n²) complexity)

You: Can you show me a better approach?

Bot: Sure! Here's a more efficient solution using a hash map:

```python
# Instead of nested loops O(n²)
for i in items:
    for j in items:
        if i.id == j.parent_id:
            # ...

# Use a hash map O(n)
parent_map = {item.id: item for item in items}
for item in items:
    parent = parent_map.get(item.parent_id)
    if parent:
        # ...
```

This reduces complexity from O(n²) to O(n), which is much faster
for large datasets.

You: That makes sense! Can you apply this fix?

Bot: I'll generate the complete fix. One moment...

[Bot generates and posts the fix]
```

#### Example 2: Security Discussion
```markdown
Bot: 🔒 Security Issue: Hardcoded API key detected

You: This is just for development. Is it really a problem?

Bot: Yes, even development keys can be problematic:

1. **Risk of accidental commit** - Dev keys often end up in production
2. **Exposure in version control** - Keys visible in git history
3. **Team access** - Anyone with repo access sees the key
4. **Rotation difficulty** - Hard to change keys in code

**Better approach:**
- Use environment variables
- Use .env files (gitignored)
- Use secret management services

Would you like me to show you how to refactor this?

You: Yes please!

Bot: [Generates refactored code with environment variables]
```

## 🔄 Auto-Fix Workflow

Complete workflow for automatic code fixes:

### Step 1: Bot Detects Issue
```markdown
🐛 **Bug Detected** (Medium Severity)

File opened but not explicitly closed. This can lead to resource leaks.

**Location:** `app.py:42`
**Suggestion:** Use context manager (`with` statement)
```

### Step 2: Request Fix
```markdown
You: /fix
```

### Step 3: Bot Generates Fix
```markdown
## 🤖 Auto-Fix Applied

I've generated a fix for the issue at `app.py:42`.

### 📝 Changes Made:
Converted file handling to use context manager for automatic cleanup

### 💻 Fixed Code:
```python
# Before
file = open('data.txt', 'r')
data = file.read()
file.close()

# After
with open('data.txt', 'r') as file:
    data = file.read()
# File automatically closed
```

### 🧪 Testing Recommendations:
- Verify file is properly closed after use
- Test error handling scenarios
- Check for any file descriptor leaks

### 🚀 Next Steps:
1. Review the changes above
2. Reply with `/apply` to create a commit
3. Reply with `/reject` to discard
```

### Step 4: Apply or Reject
```markdown
# To apply the fix
You: /apply

# To reject the fix
You: /reject not needed for this case
```

### Step 5: Bot Creates Commit (if applied)
```markdown
## ✅ Fix Applied

I've created a commit with the fix:

**Commit:** `abc123f`
**Branch:** `blackbox-ai/fix-42-app-py`
**Message:** "fix: Use context manager for file handling"

The fix has been applied to your PR. Please review and test!
```
